  * Weight (3 days)

  As well as the above features, the app is designed to backup user data as historic data, allowing the user to remove the app and restore data back to the device.

## Updates

## Todo

  * Add background support with notification updates
  * Add more support for different measurements based on where user is based. (Metric/Imperial)
  * Alter interface - settings colours and change "Distance Profile" to Workouts.
